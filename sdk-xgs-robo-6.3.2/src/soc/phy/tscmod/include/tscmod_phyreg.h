/*!
\file tscmod_phyreg.h Declares verilog interface functions.
This file contains declarations of functions that are necessary to 
hook up TSCMod to various verilog platforms. The drivers of TSCMod are
hooked to verilog tasks as a first level interface to the actual drivers in the 
verilog testbench. These 'C' functions and verilog tasks are attached via 
a mechanism called 'DPI' (direct programming interface) supported by all
verilog simulators.  Note that C platforms need no special attachments.

	 Mutex and Semaphore Synchronization with BCM Libraries

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Semaphores

sal_sem_t

1.1. Binary semaphores

1.2. Counting semaphores

2. Mutexes

sal_mutex_t

2.1. Recursive Mutex

The SAL must implement 'recursive' mutexes similar to the ones provided
by VxWorks.  The same task may take the mutex multiple times and an
internal count is kept of the number of times the mutex has been taken.

Recursive mutexes permit lower level routines to lock resources without
worrying if a higher level routine has already locked it.

It is easy to build 'recursive' mutexes on top of non-recursive ones
such as POSIX mutexes.  See the unix SAL implementation for an example.

2.2. Signal blocking

The SAL mutex implementation should block user aborts (SIGINT or
Control-C) as long as any mutex is held by the task running on the
console.  Otherwise, the signal may result in a longjmp somewhere else
and and the mutex will never be released.

See the VxWorks and unix SAL implementations for examples.

3. Timeouts

	    Instructions for NFS mounting onto Broadcom SDKs

			Curt McDowell, 10-08-01

(1) Host table entry

    VxWorks NFS requires a host name be used.  You can't mount an IP
    address.  The BCM "host" command allows manipulating the VxWorks
    host table.

    Add a host table entry for your NFS server:

	host add fs-sj1-20 10.16.128.50

(2) NFS authentication

    Use the BCM "nfs" command to set the authorization (numeric user and
    group ID on the server) that will be used for all server file I/O:

	nfs auth fs-sj1-20 10011 20    

    Although the name of the file server is required, you may not be
    able to use different authentication parameters on different servers.

    An optional list of Authorized Group IDs may follow the
    authentication group ID.

(3) NFS mounts

    Use the BCM "nfs" command to mount a specified server directory
    on a SDK path name, for example:

	nfs mount fs-sj1-20:/vol/vol2/home2/labguy /home/labguy

    There is a corresponding "nfs unmount" command.

    After mounting, you (and .soc or .tcl scripts) can "cd" to
    /home/labguy and access the labguy account directly.

(4) Using gateways

    In order to mount a filesystem from a server that is not on the
    same subnet, set the "gateway" boot parameter to point to the default
    router on the SDK's subnet, for example 192.168.2.1.

    In the Mousse and IDTRP334 BSPs, Broadcom has modified usrNetwork.c
    to add a default route (0.0.0.0) to the gateway router.

(5) Automatic mounts on system startup

    Create a BCM script on the flash filesystem to perform the desired
    mount commands.  For example, create "flash:sysinit.soc" with the
    contents:

	echo Mounting /home/labguy
	host add fs-sj1-20 10.16.128.50
	nfs auth fs-sj1-20 10011 20    
	nfs mount fs-sj1-20:/vol/vol2/home2/labguy /home/labguy
	# If the following line is used, the default directory for "cd"
	# will be changed and rc.soc will be loaded from the new directory.
	cd -sethome /home/labguy/boot/current

    Then in the boot ROM parameters, set the "boot script" parameter
    to "flash:sysinit.soc".

    The "boot script" is a feature that can be used for general
    board initialization procedures.  If supplied, this script is run
    once per boot, before rc.soc.  NOTE: this is independent of rc.soc,
    which normally runs once per attached device.

    sysinit.soc may mount multiple filesystems.

(6) FTP access

    FTP access is (almost) unaffected.  You can still use

	cd tornado%tornado+\@borg:/home/labguy

    to access labguy from FTP access, and plain

	cd

    will still take you back to the FTP home directory (boot location).

    rc.soc is still loaded using FTP so that it comes from the same
    directory the image was booted from.

    One difference: the command

	cd /home/labguy

    will now take you to the NFS mounted directory, whereas it used to
    take you to the FTP directory:

	tornado%tornado+@borg:/home/labguy

    However, for backwards compatibility, this new behavior applies only
    if anything has been NFS-mounted.  Otherwise it behaves the old way.

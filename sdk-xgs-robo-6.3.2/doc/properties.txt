		   Notes on Configuration Properties
		 Curt McDowell, Broadcom Corp. 12-12-02
			 Last Updated: 12-12-02
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are many configuration parameters called "properties" available to
the driver to customize its behavior.  These parameters have been
grouped into one place for two reasons:

* Have a common place to customize all aspects of driver operation
  without having the parameters sprinkled all around the driver code.

* Allow optional run-time modification of these parameters so the driver
  can be customized without recompiling an image.

A property is name=value pair where both name and value are strings.
For most properties, the value is parsed as a numeric and can be
formatted in decimal, or in hex with a '0x' prefix, similar to a
constant in the C language.  For example,

	mmu_sdram_enable=1

Each property has a default value that is compiled into the driver and
takes effect if the property is not customized.

To allow different property values for different units or chips, each
property is looked up with the following suffixes in order:

	Suffix			Example

	.<unit-num>             mmu_sdram_enable.0
	.<CHIP_TYPE>            mmu_sdram_enable.BCM5680_B0
	.<CHIP_GROUP>           mmu_sdram_enable.BCM5680
	<nothing>               mmu_sdram_enable

The per-port properties are looked up with various port related
suffixes in the following order:

	Suffix			Example

	_<port_name>		phy_null_fe0
	_<port_type>		phy_null_fe
	_<port_number>		phy_null_port1
	<nothing>		phy_null

Port numbers start are counted from 1 up to the number of enabled
ports on the chip.

The per-port properties also have the unit or chip based suffixes
described above added as well, so:

	Example			Meaning

	phy_null		applies to all ports on all units
	phy_null_fe		applies to fast ethernet ports on all units
	phy_null_fe3.1		applies to port fe3 on unit 1

All of the supported properties can be found in the file
$SDK/rc/config.bcm, along with a comment explaining the purpose of the
property and the default value of the property.  Lines in config.bcm
that are preceded by a pound sign (#) are comments.  In general, all of
the properties are commented out, so their default value will take
effect.  They must be uncommented to change the value.

The values of properties are set in three ways:

* First, the Makefiles distributed with the SDK software allow the
  values of chosen properties to compiled into the driver so they are
  preset at the time of driver initialization.

* Second, if the appropriate support is provided in the User SAL,
  additional properties are then loaded from the file "flash:config.bcm"
  at runtime. This is great for customizing per platform or CPU board
  for testing.

* Third, if the BCM Diagnostics Shell is compiled in, property values
  may be changed from the command line using the "config" command:

	config <name>=<value>		Set value of existing property
	config add <name>=<value>	Must use 'add' if not already there
	config delete <name>		Remove property (restore default)
	config save			Save changes to non-volatile storage

  If the value of a property is changed in this way, it may take effect
  immediately, or upon re-initializing (rc.soc), or upon rebooting the
  system.  Which one is dependent on the particular property.

The Makefiles distributed with the SDK software provide a way to compile
into the application the default values of various properties.  This is
also useful to permanently fix the properties will be never loaded at
runtime because there is no flash device to store the config.bcm file or
no user SAL support for file operations.

During the build process, the Makefile in $SDK/make/Make.vxworks
processes the contents of $SDK/rc/config.bcm through a PERL script found
in $SDK/tools/bcm2c.pl.  Any properties that are NOT commented out are
converted to a C function call to set the property, for example

	sal_config_set("name", "value")

These function calls are placed in the routine
sal_config_init_defaults() in a file named platform_defines.c in the
build directory $SDK/build/vxworks-<platform>, and subsequently
compiled into platform_defines.o and linked in.  The routine
sal_config_init_defaults() is called during SAL initialization.

It is also possible for the user to simply add calls to sal_config_set()
in the code where sal_config_init_defaults() would normally be called.

In the standard SDK, the soc_property routines, found in $SDK/src/drv.c,
are implemented using the SAL Config module and the routines
sal_config_set/reg found in the User SAL.

;
; This is the default program for the 12 port 56802 based CX4 LM
; To start it, use the following commands from BCM:
;
;       led load lm12p56802.hex
;       led auto on
;       led start
;
; There are 48 LEDS four each for 10G ports
; There is one bit per 10G LED with the following colors:
;       ZERO     Black
;       ONE      Green
;
; The chip drives its LEDs and needs to write them in the order:
;       L01,T01, R01, E01,  ..., L12,T12, R12, E12
;
; Link up/down info cannot be derived from LINKEN or LINKUP, as the LED
; processor does not always have access to link status.  This program
; assumes link status is kept current in bit 0 of RAM byte (0x80 + portnum).
; Generally, a program running on the main CPU must update these
; locations on link change; see linkscan callback in
; $SDK/src/appl/diag/ledproc.c.
;
; Link activity info for Higig/XE ports are not updated by LED processor in
; 56800. The counter DMA task reports the activities of Higig/Xe ports
; in bit 1-5 of RAM byte (0x94 + portnum). Bit 1 indicates that the link
; activity is high. Bit 2 indicates that the link activity is medium. Bit
; 3 indicates that the link activity is low. If all three bits are clear, there
; is no activity on the link. Bit 4 indicates TX activity and Bit 5 indicates
; RX activity. See counter DMA task in $SDK/src/soc/counter.c
;
; Current implementation:
;
; L01-L12 reflects 10G link status:
;       Black: no link
;       Green: Link
; T01-T12 reflects port 1-12 TX activity
;       Black: idle
;       Green: TX (pulse extended to 1/3 sec)
; R01-R12 reflects port 1-12 RX activity
;       Black: idle
;       Green: RX (pulse extended to 1/3 sec)
; E01-E12 reflects 10G link enable
;       Black: Disable
;       Green: Enable
;

;
; This is the default program for the (25 GE + 6 XE/HG port) BCM56626 SDKs.
; To start it, use the following commands from BCM:
;
;       led load sdk56626.hex
;       led auto on
;       led start
;
; The is 1 LEDs per XE port. 
;
; There is one bit per 10 gigabit Ethernet LED with the following colors:
;       ONE 		Black
;       ZERO            Green
;
; Each chip drives only its own LEDs and needs to write them in the order:
;       A01/L01, L02/A02, ..., L06/A06
;
; Link up/down info cannot be derived from LINKEN or LINKUP, as the LED
; processor does not always have access to link status.  This program
; assumes link status is kept current in bit 0 of RAM byte (0xA0 + portnum).
; Generally, a program running on the main CPU must update these
; locations on link change; see linkscan callback in
; $SDK/src/appl/diag/ledproc.c.
;
; Current implementation:
;
; L01/A01 reflects port 1 link status:
;       Black: no link
;       Green: Link/Activity

; link_activity
;
;  This routine calculates the activity LED for the current port.
;  It extends the activity lights using timers (new activity overrides
;  and resets the timers).
;
;  Inputs: (PORT_NUM)

;
;  This routine finds the link status LED for a port.

# Makefile - Standalone makefile for BCM570x driver
#
# modification history
# --------------------
# 01a,11jun02,jmb   Written
#
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#    This is a standalone makefile for building the BCM570x network driver.
#    (It is here for illustrative purposes only.  For Strataswitch builds, the
#    driver is built in the BSP directory.)
#
#    Here's how to build for a PPC8245
#
#        make -f Makefile CPU=PPC603 TOOL=gnu
#
#    The results of the build will be a partially linked object module
#    called $(CPU)$(TOOL)/bcm570xdrv.o
#
#    Here's an example MIPS build
#
#        make -f Makefile CPU=RX32364 TOOL=sfgnu
#
#    N.B:  The standalone MIPS build for the RC32364 is currently broken because the
#          driver requires a header file in the idtrp334 BSP.  This needs to be
#          fixed at some point -- drivers shouldn't require any BSP headers.
#

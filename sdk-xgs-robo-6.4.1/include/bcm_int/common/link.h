/*
 * Driver specific routines description
 *
 * Function:
 *     ld_hw_interrupt
 * Purpose:
 *     Routine handler for hardware linkscan interrupt.
 * Parameters:
 *     unit - Device unit number
 *     pbmp - (OUT) Returns bitmap of ports that require hardware re-scan
 *
 *
 * Function:
 *     ld_port_link_get
 * Purpose:
 *     Return current PHY up/down status.
 * Parameters:
 *     unit - Device unit number
 *     port - Device port number
 *     hw   - If TRUE, assume hardware linkscan is active and use it
 *              to reduce PHY reads.
 *            If FALSE, do not use information from hardware linkscan.
 *     up   - (OUT) TRUE for link up, FALSE for link down.
 *
 *
 * Function:
 *     ld_internal_select
 * Purpose:
 *     Select the source of the CMIC link status interrupt
 *     to be the Internal Serdes on given port.
 * Parameters:
 *     unit - Device unit number
 *     port - Device port number
 *
 *
 * Function:
 *     ld_update_asf
 * Purpose:
 *     Update Alternate Store and Forward parameters for a port.
 * Parameters:
 *     unit   - Device unit number
 *     port   - Device port number
 *     linkup - port link state (0=down, 1=up)
 *     speed  - port speed
 *     duplex - port duplex (0=half, 1=full)
 *
 *
 * Function:
 *     ld_trunk_sw_failover_trigger
 * Purpose:
 *     Remove specified ports with link down from trunks.
 * Parameters:
 *     unit        - Device unit number
 *     pbmp_active - Bitmap of ports
 *     pbmp_status - Bitmap of port status

/*
 * Driver specific routines description
 *
 * Function:
 *     ld_linkscan_hw_init
 * Purpose:
 *     Initialize device specific HW linkscan.
 * Parameters:
 *     unit - Device unit number
 *
 *
 * Function:
 *     ld_linkscan_config
 * Purpose:
 *     Set ports to hardware linkscan.
 * Parameters:
 *     unit       - Device unit number

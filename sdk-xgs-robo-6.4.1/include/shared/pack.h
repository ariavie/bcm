 * File:        pack.h
 * Purpose:     Pack and unpack macros using Big-Endian (network byte order).
 *
 * Pack and unpack macros:
 *   _SHR_PACK_U8    : Packs a uint8, advances pointer
 *   _SHR_UNPACK_U8  : Unpacks a uint8, advances pointer
 *   _SHR_PACK_U16   : Packs a uint16, advances pointer
 *   _SHR_UNPACK_U16 : Unpacks a uint16, advances pointer
 *   _SHR_PACK_U32   : Packs a uint32, advances pointer
 *   _SHR_UNPACK_U32 : Unpacks a uint32, advances pointer
 *
 * The pack/unpack macros take (_buf, _var)
 * where,
 *     _buf  - is a pointer to buffer where to pack or unpack value;
 *             should be of type 'uint8 *', or 'char *'.
 *     _var  - is the variable with value to pack, or to unpack to.
 * 
 * NOTE:
 * All above macros increment the given buffer pointer based
 * on the corresponding type size.
 *
 * Avoid expressions in these macros (side effects).

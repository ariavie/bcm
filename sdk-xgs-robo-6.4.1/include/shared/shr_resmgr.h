 *  WARNING: No locking is performed here (unless it is implied by the

 *  WARNING: No locking is performed here (unless it is implied by the
 *  underlying allocator) for any of the shr_res_* calls, except for the case
 *  of shr_res_init and shr_res_detach.  For other shr_res_* calls, the caller
 *  must ensure that it is not possible for calls against a specific unit to

 *
 *  NOTE: The actual mutual exclusion requirement is at the pool granularity,
 *  but since it is possible to have different types share the same pool, and
 *  the caller is not required to know the exact mapping, it can be dangerous
 *  for the caller to assume locking by type is sufficient.  Since allocation
 *  is managed by type, which is mapped internally to pool, the general
 *  assumption of complete exclusivity is safer.
 *
 *  Other than the *_dump calls, the shr_mres_* calls and the shr_res_* calls
 *  are designed to function in parallel or timesliced as long as there are no
 *  multiple concurrent invocations against the same unit or handle.  The
 *  *_dump calls use bsl_print, and suffer from any threading or timeslicing

 *      (IN) handle   : handle for the instance to access

 *      requested base element does not comply with the indicated alignment,
 *      BCM_E_PARAM will be returned.
 *
 *      This will allocate a single block of the requested number of elements
 *      of this resource.
 *
 *      This function can not be used with a 'scaled' allocator.
 *
 *      The first element of the returned block will be at ((n * align) +
 *      offset), where n is some integer.  If it is not possible to allocate a
 *      block with the requested constraints, the call will fail.  Note that
 *      the alignment is within the specified range of the resource, and not

 *
 *      Some allocators may not support this feature; some may place
 *      restrictions, such as the base alignment being a power of two, or not
 *      supporting the ALIGN_ZERO flag.
 *
 *      Partial blocks will not be allocated.
 *
 *      The pattern argument is a bitmap of the elements that are of interest
 *      in a single iteration of the pattern (and only the least significant
 *      'length' bits are used; higher bits are ignored).  The bit with value
 *      (1 << k) set indicates the element at (elem + k) must be in the block;
 *      clear it indicates the element at (elem + k) is not in the block.  This
 *      repeats for as many iterations as indicated by 'repeats'.
 *
 *      For example:
 *        align = 4, offs = 0, pattern = 0x7, length = 8, repeats = 2 would
 *        request a block of three elements, a gap of one element, and then
 *        another block of three elements, with the first allocated element
 *        aligned to a multiple of four.
 *
 *        align = 8, offs = 1, pattern = 0x1, length = 2, repeats = 4 would
 *        request four oddly numbered elements with the first one allocated at
 *        (8 * n) + 1 where n is some arbitrary number.
 *
 *      Note the bitmap is considered based at the requested alignment+offset,
 *      even if the least significant bit is not set, so it is probably
 *      simplest to ensure the LSb of pattern is set.
 *
 *      For example:
 *        align = 4, offs = 0, pattern = 0xA, length = 4, repeats = 1 would
 *        request two elements, but the returned base element number would be
 *        (4 * n), while the actually allocated elements would be (4 * n) + 1
 *        and (4 * n) + 3.
 *
 *      The caller must track the pattern, length and repeats values and
 *      provide these values along with the elem value when freeing the block.
 *
 *      Any allocation made through this function must be freed using the
 *      shr_mres_free_sparse function.
 *
 *      Sparse functions do not work with scaled resources.

 *      This will free a sparse block of elements, starting at the specified
 *      element and proceeding as specified.
 *
 *      This function can not be used with a 'scaled' allocator.
 *
 *      This should only be called with valid data (base element, pattern,
 *      length, repeats).  Trying to free a block that is not in use or trying
 *      to free something that spans multiple allocated blocks may not work.
 *
 *      Anything allocated with shr_mres_alloc_align_sparse must be freed using
 *      this function.  While it is possible to use this function to free
 *      blocks allocated with other functions, it is not advised.
 *
 *      Sparse functions do not work with scaled resources.
 *
 *      While this can be used to free non-sparse blocks, it is probably best
 *      to use the non-sparse free functions for that purpose.

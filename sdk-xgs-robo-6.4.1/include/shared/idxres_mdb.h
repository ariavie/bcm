/*
 *  This defines the bitmap that is used to control allocation and freeing
 *  behaviour of an mdb object.  Note that there are several bitfields here,
 *  not just a few bits or a set of values, and that the setting is specific to
 *  a single mdb object (many can exist with different settings).
 *
 *  The alloc_bank set chooses the initial mechanism used to find the free
 *  space as the first part of the alloc process.  The 'first' setting does not
 *  mean 'low numbers', it basically means pick the space of the appropriate
 *  size which is fastest to locate, and is the fastest mechanism, plus it has
 *  the best cache use in case of high-speed thrashing that can fall within a
 *  single bank.  The 'high' setting means search for space from the highest
 *  bank toward the lowest; the 'low' setting means search for space from the
 *  lowest bank toward the highest.  Both of these settings are much slower but
 *  can be helpful if trying to collect allocated blocks toward one end of the
 *  space.  Only pick one from this set of options.
 *
 *  The alloc_block setting chooses whether to bias an alloc block toward the
 *  high end or low end of a free block that is too large (which it will be
 *  unless the alloc block is exactly one of the free lists sizes, and it may
 *  still be in that case if there were no exact size free blocks).  This
 *  setting takes effect AFTER the alloc join setting.  Only pick one from this
 *  set of options.
 *
 *  The free_block setting chooses whether to bias a freed block that is not an
 *  exact number of elements for any free list so that the largest block is on
 *  the high or low end of the block.  This setting takes effect AFTER the free
 *  join setting.  Only pick one from this set of options.
 *
 *  The join_alloc and join_free options indicate whether adjacent free blocks
 *  are combined on alloc and free.  If neither is chosen, free is assumed.
 *  Selecting free tends to coalesce larger free blocks, making larger alloc
 *  requests possible (can't alloc a block that is bigger than the largest free
 *  block); selecting alloc tends to reduce free space fragmentation (by
 *  coalescing the allocated blocks in a given bank); selecting both gains both
 *  features, at a slight performance cost compared to only one or the other.
 *
 *  The join directions indicate which direction will be searched for adjacent
 *  free blocks when joining.  It should be reasonably efficient to allow both
 *  directions.  If neither is chosen, high is assumed.

 *  Function
 *    shr_mdb_create
 *

 *    Create an mdb type indexed resource management object, given the
 *    specified parameters for the object.
 *
 *    Elements per bank will be rounded up to the next integral power of two,
 *    and that must be <=32768.
 *
 *    A free list of block size = 1 is obligatory (and implied); additional
 *    free lists (as specified by freeLists) have their block sizes given in an
 *    array pointed to by freeCnts.
 *
 *    FreeCnts entries must be in strictly increasing order, and the largest
 *    must be less than or equal to bankSize.  The largest freeCnts entry will
 *    be the largest block that can be allocated, so at least one freeCnts
 *    entry must be greater than or equal to the largest block you will need.
 *    Ideally, freeCnts entries will tend to be the most commonly used block
 *    sizes, plus possibly some larger block sizes for more efficient
 *    management of free space.
 *
 *    UserLists specifies the number of user lists that will be included.
 *    These allow in-place use of the existing management memory to track lists
 *    of blocks for whatever purpose is necessary, and allow any size block,
 *    but these lists will be unsorted and unordered.

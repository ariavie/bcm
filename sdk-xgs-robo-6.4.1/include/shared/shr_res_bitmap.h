/*

 *   Purpose
 *      Allocate an element or sparse block of elements of a particular

 *   Parameters
 *      (IN) handle   : handle for the instance to access

 *   Returns
 *      BCM_E_NONE if successful
 *      BCM_E_* as appropriate otherwise
 *   Notes
 *      The elem argument is IN if the WITH_ID flag is specified; it is OUT if
 *      the WITH_ID flag is not specified.  If WITH_ID is specified, and the
 *      requested base element does not comply with the indicated alignment,
 *      BCM_E_PARAM will be returned.
 *
 *      This will allocate a single block of the requested number of elements
 *      of this resource.
 *
 *      The first element of the returned block will be at ((n * align) +
 *      offset), where n is some integer.  If it is not possible to allocate a
 *      block with the requested constraints, the call will fail.  Note that
 *      the alignment is within the specified range of the resource, and not
 *      specifically aligned against the absolute value zero; to request the
 *      alignment be against zero, specify the ALIGN_ZERO flag.
 *
 *      If offset >= align, BCM_E_PARAM.  If align is zero or negative, it will
 *      be treated as if it were 1.
 *
 *      Partial blocks will not be allocated.
 *
 *      The pattern argument is a bitmap of the elements that are of interest
 *      in a single iteration of the pattern (and only the least significant
 *      'length' bits are used; higher bits are ignored).  The bit with value
 *      (1 << k) set indicates the element at (elem + k) must be in the block;
 *      clear it indicates the element at (elem + k) is not in the block.  This
 *      repeats for as many iterations as indicated by 'repeats'.
 *
 *      For example:
 *        align = 4, offs = 0, pattern = 0x7, length = 8, repeats = 2 would
 *        request a block of three elements, a gap of one element, and then
 *        another block of three elements, with the first allocated element
 *        aligned to a multiple of four.
 *
 *        align = 8, offs = 1, pattern = 0x1, length = 2, repeats = 4 would
 *        request four oddly numbered elements with the first one allocated at
 *        (8 * n) + 1 where n is some arbitrary number.
 *
 *      Note the bitmap is considered based at the requested alignment+offset,
 *      even if the least significant bit is not set, so it is probably
 *      simplest to ensure the LSb of pattern is set.
 *
 *      For example:
 *        align = 4, offs = 0, pattern = 0xA, length = 4, repeats = 1 would
 *        request two elements, but the returned base element number would be
 *        (4 * n), while the actually allocated elements would be (4 * n) + 1
 *        and (4 * n) + 3.
 *
 *      The caller must track the pattern, length and repeats values and
 *      provide these values along with the elem value when freeing the block.
 *
 *      Any allocation made through this function must be freed using the
 *      shr_res_bitmap_free_sparse function.

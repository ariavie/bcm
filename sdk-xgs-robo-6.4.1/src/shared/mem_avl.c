/*
 *
 *     The memory management scheme works as follows:
 *
 *     Structure:
 *         AVL Tree:
 *           Each node in the tree describes a free block of memory.
 *           Said node has the number of memory units contained in the block,
 *           as well as the starting address (within the block) of the
 *           block.
 *         Doubly Linked List:
 *           The nodes within the aforementioned tree have previous and next
 *           pointers to allow for a DLL.  This DLL is used to coalesce
 *           adjacent free blocks, reducing fragmentation, and allowing for
 *           larger blocks to be allocated.
 *
 *     Initialization:
 *           We start with a single node avl tree.  This is deemed the 'free'
 *           block tree.  The node has the entire memory to be managed and is
 *           the head of our doubly linked list.
 *
 *     Allocation:
 *           We execute a best fit search of the free tree.
 *           The node returned to us is removed from the tree.  If the node
 *           returned to us is larger than our need, we split off the
 *           unused portion and add said portion back into the tree.
 *           We mark the allocated portion used, insert the remainder
 *           into the DLL (the allocated node was already in the DLL).
 *           We then return the memory address to the user.
 *
 *     ReAlloc:
 *           If the realloc size is identical, we simply return the same
 *           address to the user.
 *           Otherwise, we free the associated block, (with possible
 *           coalescence), and allocate a fresh block.
 *           One item of note, this implementation of realloc does not
 *           copy the original contents of the memory to the new location.
 *
 *     Free:
 *           Find the node (within the DLL) associated with this block of
 *           memory.  If the previous block is free also, coalesce the two
 *           blocks into one.  If the next block is free, coalesce that block
 *           into this one.  Mark the memory as free in the DLL, and add it to
 *           the free tree.

$Revision: 1.1 $

This is a line-editing library.  It can be linked into almost any
program to provide command-line editing and recall.

It is call-compatible with the FSF readline library, but it is a
fraction of the size (and offers fewer features).  It does not use
standard I/O.  It is distributed under a "C News-like" copyright.

Configuration is done in the Makefile.  Type "make testit" to get
a small slow shell for testing.

This contains some changes since the posting to comp.sources.misc:
    -   Bugfix for completion on absolute pathnames.
    -   Better handling of M-n versus showing raw 8bit chars.
    -   Better signal handling.
    -   Now supports termios/termio/sgttyb ioctl's.
    -   Add M-m command to toggle how 8bit data is displayed.
The following changes, made since the last public release, come from
J.G. Vons <vons@cesar.crbca1.sinet.slb.com>:
    -   History-searching no longer redraws the line wrong
    -   Added ESC-ESC as synonym for ESC-?
    -   SIGQUIT (normally ^\) now sends a signal, not indicating EOF.
    -   Fixed some typo's and unclear wording in the manpage.
    -   Fixed completion when all entries shared a common prefix.
    -   Fixed some meta-char line-redrawing bugs.

Enjoy,

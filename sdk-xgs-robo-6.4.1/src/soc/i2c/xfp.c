/*
 * Function: xfp_ack_poll
 *
 * Purpose:  Poll the device to determine if it is ready for IO.
 *           When the chip writes data, it will become unresponsive
 *           for a period of Time Tw (Internal Write Delay). We could
 *           either wait the maximum amount of time for the device to
 *           finish it's write-cycle (10ms), or we can poll the device
 *           for a specified operation (r/w) until it responds with an
 *           ACK. This routine polls the device until it is responsive.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *    unit - StrataSwitch device number or I2C bus number
 *    bus_addr - chip IO (I2C) slave bus address byte(s)
 *
 * Returns:
 *     Number of Poll operations required to contact device, or
 *     XFP_ACK_RETRY_COUNT if the device is not online or responding.
 *
 *
 * Notes:
 *     See also: soc_i2c_ack_poll

/*
 * Function: xfp_read
 *
 * Purpose: Read len bytes of data into buffer, update len with total

 *    devno - chip device id
 *    addr - XFP memory address to read from
 *    data - address of data buffer to read into

 * Returns: data bufffer filled in with data from address, number of

 *          SOC_E_NONE -- no error encounter
 *          SOC_E_TIMEOUT - chip timeout or data error
 *
 * Notes:
 *         Currently uses random address byte read to initiate the read; if
 *         more than one byte of data is requested at the current address, a
 *         sequential read operation is performed.

 *     into one write which is not page aligned, and the remainder as

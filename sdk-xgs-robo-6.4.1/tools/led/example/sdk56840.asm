;
; This is the default program for the (36 port) BCM56840 SDKs.
; There are two LED processors on BCM56840. 
; To start the first one, use the following commands from BCM:
;
;       led load sdk56840.hex
;       led auto on
;       led start
; To start the second one:
;
;       led 1 load sdk56840.hex
;       led 1 auto on
;       led 1 start
;
; The are 2 LEDs per port one for Link and one for activity.
;
; There are two bits per LED with the following colors:
;       ZERO, ZERO      Black
;       ZERO, ONE       Green
;       ONE, ZERO       Amber
;
; Each chip drives only its own LEDs and needs to write them in the order:
;       A01, L01, A02, L02, ..., A24, L24, A25, L25, ..., A35, L35
;
; Link up/down info cannot be derived from LINKEN or LINKUP, as the LED
; processor does not always have access to link status.  This program
; assumes link status is kept current in bit 0 of RAM byte (0x80 + portnum).
; Generally, a program running on the main CPU must update these
; locations on link change; see linkscan callback in
; $SDK/src/appl/diag/ledproc.c.
;
; Current implementation:
;
; L01 reflects port 1 link status:
;       Black: no link
;       Amber: below 10 Gb/s
;       Green: 10 Gb/s and above
;
; A01 reflects port 1 activity (even if port is down)
;       Black: idle
;       Green: RX (pulse extended to 1/3 sec)
;       Amber: TX (pulse extended to 1/3 sec, takes precedence over RX)
;       Green/Amber alternating at 6 Hz: both RX and TX
;
; Scan chain assembly area should start 0x4A and takes 32bytes

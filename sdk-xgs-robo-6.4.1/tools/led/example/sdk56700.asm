;
; This is the default program for the (16 port) BCM56700 SDKs.
; To start it, use the following commands from BCM:
;
;       led load sdk56700.hex
;       led auto on
;       led start
;
; The is 1 LED per GX port, which is used for both link and activity.
;
; There are two bits per gigabit Ethernet LED with the following colors:
;       ZERO, ZERO      Black
;       ZERO, ONE       Amber
;       ONE, ZERO       Green
;
; Each chip drives only its own LED and needs to write them in the order:
;       L01, L02, ..., L16
;
; Link up/down info cannot be derived from LINKEN or LINKUP, as the LED
; processor does not always have access to link status.  This program
; assumes link status is kept current in bit 0 of RAM byte (0x80 + portnum).
; Generally, a program running on the main CPU must update these
; locations on link change; see linkscan callback in
; $SDK/src/appl/diag/ledproc.c.
;
; Link activity info for Higig/XE ports are not updated by LED processor in
; 56700_a0. The counter DMA task reports the activities of Higig/Xe ports
; in bit 1-3 of RAM byte (0x94 + portnum). Bit 1 indicates that the link
; activity is high. Bit 2 indicates that the link activity is medium. Bit
; 3 indicates that the link activity is low. If all three bits are clear, there
; is no activity on the link. See counter DMA task in $SDK/src/soc/counter.c
;
; Current implementation:
;
; L01 reflects port 1 link and activity status:
;       Black: no link
;       Green: link
;   when port speed is higher than 2.5G,
;       Green/Amber alternating at approximately 2 Hz (low activity)
;       Green/Amber alternating at approximately 4 Hz (medium activity)
;       Green/Amber alternating at approximately 8 Hz (high activity)
;
;   when port speed is 2.5G and less,
;       Black: idle
;       Green: RX (pulse extended to 1/3 sec)
;       Amber: TX (pulse extended to 1/3 sec, takes precedence over RX)
;       Green/Amber alternating at 6 Hz: both RX and TX
;

MAX_PORT        EQU     15

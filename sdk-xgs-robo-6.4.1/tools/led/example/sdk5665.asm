;
; This is the default program for the 5665 SDK (BCM95665K4S)
;
; To start it, use the following commands from BCM:
;
;	0:led load sdk5665.hex
;	*:led start
;
; The BCM5665 SDK has 26 columns of 4 LEDs each, as shown below:
;
;       L01 L03 L05 L07 L09 L11 L13 L15 L17 L19 ... L47 LG1 LG3 
;       A01 A03 A05 A07 A09 A11 A13 A15 A17 A19 ... A47 AG1 LG3
;       L02 L04 L06 L08 L10 L12 L14 L16 L18 L20 ... L48 LG2 LG4
;       A02 A04 A06 A08 A10 A12 A14 A16 A18 A20 ... A48 AG2 LG4
;
; There is one bit per LED with the following colors:
;	ZERO		Green
;	ONE		Black
;
; The bits are shifted out in the following order:
;	A01, L01, ..., A48, L48, AG1, LG1, ..., AG4, LG4
;
; Current implementation:
;
; L01 reflects port 1 link status
; A01 reflects port 1 activity
;
; On the bringup board, the LED polarity is 0 on, 1 off.

;
; This bit is a workaround for a bug in the 5665 LED processor.
; 
; The pack instruction should put the data into data mem at 0x80.
; However, the internal register to store this address is only 7 bits.
; So the data is packed starting at address 0.
; This leads to two caveats:    
; 
; 1) Port 0 data _MUST_ be consumed before the first pack instruction.
; 
; 2) The output data must be moved from location 0 to location 128.

In their local and remote advertisement registers, IEEE PHYs denote the
enabling of transmission and reception of pause frames in terms of a
PAUSE bit and an ASM_DIR bit.

The Local Resolution portion of table, expressed as formulae:

Local Advert
        LP = PAUSE
        LA = ASM_DIR

Remote Advert
        RP = PAUSE
        RA = ASM_DIR

Local Resolution (MAC programming)
        TX = Enable transmit of pause frames
        RX = Enable receive of pause frames

(1) RX = LP RP + LP LA RA = LP (RP + LA RA)
(2) TX = LP RP + RP LA RA = RP (LP + LA RA)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Because the Broadcom PHY drivers return the advertisement information in
terms of TX and RX enable, already converted from PAUSE/ASM_DIR, the
formulae need to be converted to operate on TX and RX enable.

Local Advert
        LT = TX pause
        LR = RX pause

Remote Advert
        RT = TX pause
        RR = RX pause

MAC Result
        TX = TX pause
        RX = RX pause

(1) TX = LR RR + RR !RT  LT = RR (LR + !RT  LT)
(2) RX = LR RR + LR  RT !LT = LR (RR +  RT !LT)

These are the formulae used in bcm/esw/port.c:_bcm_port_update() to
program the MAC TX/RX enables according to autonegotiation results.
